Notes for Essay:

Systems:

- Use of electronics for the creation of "systems":

 why this is interesting for composers?
     The use of "sonification" in computer music allows for the bypassing of
     symbolic musical notation, instead opting to drive musical events
     through use of other data types (such as arbritrary weather information
     for example)
     This allows composers to distance there own discourse from the creation
     of music, relinquishing control to the data to greater degrees than is
     easily acheiveable through acoustic music.~\cite[p.129]{mclaughlin2011dsma}

- Not bound by the limitations of human performance or the timbres of
traditional instruments~\cite[p.351]{holmes2012eaem}
